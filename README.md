### Context:

[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This project was completed duringour 7th week of Turing's Front End Development program. Our focus was to learn how to navigate a codebase with pre existing code, as well as write our first set of accompanying tests. With TDD being a new concept for me, this project took around 25 hours to complete.

### Contributors:

[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
This project was completed by Robert Phillips.

### Learning Goals:

[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
Implement a robust testing suite using TDD & the [Chai Assertion Library](https://www.chaijs.com/).

### Wins + Challenges:

[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

This app has complete test-coverage for the JS game logic functions.
First time writing an entirely ES6 based JS application.
Handled my project through TDD for the first time.
